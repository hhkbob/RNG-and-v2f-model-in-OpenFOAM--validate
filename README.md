# RNG-and-v2f-model-in-OpenFOAM--validate
The RNG and the v2f model are investigated using OpenFOAM for the round jet impingement heat transfer
In this case, the impinging spacing H/D = 6, where H is the impinging distance and D denotes the nozzle diameter. The experimental data are obtained from the reference:
